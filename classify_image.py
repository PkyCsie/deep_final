"""Simple image classification with Inception.

Run image classification with Inception trained on ImageNet 2012 Challenge data
set.

This program creates a graph from a saved GraphDef protocol buffer,
and runs inference on an input JPEG image. It outputs human readable
strings of the top 5 predictions along with their probabilities.

Change the --image_file argument to any jpg image to compute a
classification of that image.

Please see the tutorial and website for a detailed description of how
to use this script to perform image recognition.
